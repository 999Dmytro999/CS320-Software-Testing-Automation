# CS320-Software-Testing-Automation

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensure my code is functional and secure by following test-driven development (TDD) principles and automating unit tests using JUnit. Automated testing allows me to detect bugs immediately after changes are made, which prevents errors from reaching production. I also follow secure coding standards, validate user input, and use proper data encapsulation to prevent unauthorized access or data leaks. Regular code reviews and static analysis tools help identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To interpret user needs, I start by reviewing software requirements and translating them into specific, testable use cases. Communication with stakeholders and detailed documentation help clarify expectations and ensure alignment. Once I understand what the user values most, I design the program structure and tests around those needs, ensuring that the features I build directly support the end-user experience. Automated acceptance and integration tests then confirm that those needs are consistently met.

How do I approach designing software?

My approach to software design begins with analyzing requirements and defining modular, reusable components. I use UML diagrams and service-oriented thinking to plan the systemâ€™s architecture before implementation. I also prioritize scalability and maintainability, ensuring each class and service has a single clear responsibility. By integrating continuous testing throughout the design and development stages, I can iteratively improve both functionality and code quality.
